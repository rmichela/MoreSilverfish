More Silverfish is a Bukkit mod that adds randomly generated Silverfish
colonies to any Bukkit world. Silverfish colonies are of random size and
shape, but are always contiguous (so they will properly swarm).

Installation: Drop in the Plugins directory and restart the server.

Configuration: config.yml is automatically created the first time the plugin
starts

- lowestLayer:   The lower boundary where Silverfish colonies will spawn
- highestLayer:  The upper boundary where Silverfish colonies will spawn
- percentChance: The percent chance a chunk will contain a Silverfish colony
- colonySize:    A multiplier that controls the size of the generated colonies
- debug:         Enables debug mode (must add yourself)
- worlds:        A list of worlds to add Silverfish colonies to

Note: When debug mode is on, glass blocks are placed in the sky above Silverfish
      colonies and the console prints out details each time a colony is created.
